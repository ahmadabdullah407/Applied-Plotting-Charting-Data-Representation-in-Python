# Description:
This repository contains Ipython notebooks of assignments and tutorials used in the course [Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-plotting),
part of [Applied Data Science using Python Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/data-science-python) from University of Michigan offered by [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
## About This Course:
This course will introduce the learner to information visualization basics, with a focus on reporting and charting using the matplotlib library. The course will start with a design and information literacy perspective, touching on what makes a good and bad visualization, and what statistical measures translate into in terms of visualizations. The second week will focus on the technology used to make visualizations in python, matplotlib, and introduce users to best practices when creating basic charts and how to realize design decisions in the framework. The third week will be a tutorial of functionality available in matplotlib, and demonstrate a variety of basic statistical charts helping learners to identify when a particular method is good for a particular problem. The course will end with a discussion of other forms of structuring and visualizing data. 

This course should be taken after Introduction to Data Science in Python and before the remainder of the Applied Data Science with Python courses: Applied Machine Learning in Python, Applied Text Mining in Python, and Applied Social Network Analysis in Python. 

This course should be taken before any of the other Applied Data Science with Python courses: Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python, Applied Machine Learning in Python, Applied Text Mining in Python, Applied Social Network Analysis in Python.

# Repository go through:
1. There are in total 5 directories in this repository.
2. 4 of these directories contains tutorials for each week individually.
3. Directory named [Assignments](https://github.com/ahmadabdullah407/Applied-Plotting-Charting-Data-Representation-in-Python/tree/main/Assignments) contains solution for assignments in this course.
4. Many directories further have sub directories which contains almost all the necessary files required or referred in Ipython notebook files tutorials and assignments.
5. Not all tutorials are Ipython notebooks some are in html format too.
6. There are pdf files for lecture slides included too.
# Reason to upload:
## Tutorials:
I have taken tutorials from course, cleaned them, added some of my personal practise in them and made them more detailed and easier to understand.If a person decides to follow tutorials in this repository instead of the ones directly in course, It will surely be easier for him to understand. 
## Assignments:
When I was doing this course, It helped me a lot in my understandings and concepts by comparing assignment approach i took and work done by other people. I am very hopefull that this would be the same for someone else.
